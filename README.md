# ExampleDesignPatternsC++

I obtained these patterns from the following website:
[Full collection of Gamma's patterns in c++](http://codingplayground.blogspot.it/2009/01/design-patterns-c-full-collection-of.html "Original Location")

I thought it would be more useful and easier to find on github.   He did not have an attached
license, I am not sure of what to license it as.  This is a list of the design patterns that are
included in these examples.


1. Creational: Abstract Factory, Builder, Factory, Prototype, Object Pool, Singleton,
2. Structural: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy patterns,
3. Behavioral: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template, Visitor, and Interpreter
